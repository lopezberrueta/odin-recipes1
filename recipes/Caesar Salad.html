    <h2> Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large or 2 small heads of romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, shredded or shaved</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Crisp croutons, homemade can be made several days ahead. The recipe below makes enough for 2 salads.
        </li>
        <li>Caesar salad dressing, homemade is best and here is our favorite store-bought dressing in a pinch</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The caesar salad dressing comes together so fast and all you need is a bowl and whisk. This Caesar dressing is light, healthy and packs so much fresh flavor without needing much salt at all.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together minced garlic, dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice and red wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>Whisking while adding oil emulsifies the dressing for a smooth and creamy (not oily) consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or to taste.</li>
        
    </ol>
